# Email_scraper-PYTHON
2 scripts and 1 .html to test the program
libraries: install pip install beautifulsoup4 requests

Two Python scripts have been uploaded, each demonstrating different methods for creating an email scraper. The first script is simpler, while the second one is enhanced to allow for manual input of the .html file. A test .html file has also been uploaded.

* if you have a website and you want to protect against email scraping:
  1. obfuscation
  2. JavaScript Redering
  3. Using a contact form
  4. Catpcha
  5. Robots.txt
 
  ENJOY!
